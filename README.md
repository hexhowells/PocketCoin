PocketCoin is a small and simple cryptocurrency / blockchain designed to learn about the technology behind blockchains as well as to learn the Go programming language and isn't a full implimentation that can or should be used.

Overview
-----

The blockchain network is comprised of 3 node types:
- ```wallet.go``` - used to broadcast transactions and get wallet balalnces
- ```node.go``` - used to broadcast transactions and mined blocks throught the network
- ```miner.go```  - used to mine new blocks

Includes the ```shards/``` folder, this contains copies of the blockchain so that a whole network can be run on the same machine without sharing a blockchain, This code is designed to be run on a single machine as node ip's are simulated using different ports.

```packge/pocketcoin/``` contains a few modules that are used in the network, these should be placed in the your ```/go/src``` folder.

Features / Notes
-----
- Miner nodes can sync their blockchain with nodes if missing any blocks
- Wallet addresses are truncated SHA256 hashes of the wallets pgp public key
- Smallest unit of PocketCoin is 0.000001œÅ
- Blocks are limited to 10 transactions (not including the coinbase transaction)
- Uses the Account Balance Model over UTXO
- Miners are rewarded a fixed amount of 10 coins for mining a block
- Mining a block takes anywhere between ~2s to ~6m (little too volatile but it'll suffice)
- Transactions are pgp signed for verification
- Pgp public keys are only broadcasted on the wallet's first transaction (pointers to a wallets public key in the blockchain are cached to reduce the blockchain size)
- Can view individual blocks, balances, and stats about the blockchain using ```blockExplorer.go```
- The mining code is not fast and could be greatly optimised thus requiring more difficult targets, current implimentation works fine for learning purposes though
- MerkleRoot in the block header is just the hash of the transactions in the body

Usage
-----
Start ```LaunchNetwork.bat``` to launch the network locally, batch file launches a few nodes and miners.
#### Node.go
```
    -f                      Specify the folder containing the blockchain.
    -p                      Specify the port that the node runs on.
```

#### Miner.go
```
    -f                      Specify the folder containing the blockchain.
    -p                      Specify the port that the miner node runs on.
    -w                      The wallet address to send the mined rewards to.
```

#### Wallet.go
```
    -f                      Specify the folder containing the wallet (wallet address, pgp keys)
    -b                      Display the wallets balance (needs to connect to a node)
    -t                      Create and send a transaction
    -w                      Display the wallet's address
    -n                      Create a new wallet address, deletes previously stored wallet address
```

#### blockExplorer.go
```
    -f                      Folder that stores the blockchain to be explored
    -b                      View the balance of all the wallets found on the network
    -blk                    Block ID of a given block to view
    -c                      View the number of coins currently in circulation
    -h                      View the current block height
    -m                      View how many blocks each miner wallet has mined
    -pub                    View all block IDs of blocks containing PGP public keys
    -t                      View all block IDs of blocks containing transactions
    -w                      View all wallet addresses found on the blockchain
```

Future Additions / Improvements
-----
- Impliment a Merkle Tree
- Look into implimenting UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)
- More robust handling of blockchain forking and orphan blocks
- More stable block mining times
